# 🪨📄✂️ Rock–Paper–Scissors Image Classification (Dicoding Project – 2022)

An image classification project that recognizes **hand gestures (Rock, Paper, Scissors)** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
Built during the **Dicoding Machine Learning Academy**, this project demonstrates how computer vision can learn visual patterns through deep learning.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project uses a **CNN model** to automatically classify images of human hands into three categories:
- 🪨 **Rock**
- 📄 **Paper**
- ✂️ **Scissors**

The dataset was provided by Dicoding and processed using **Google Colab**.  
Through **image augmentation** and multi-layer convolution, the model achieved **~95% accuracy** in recognizing hand gestures.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- Built and trained in **Google Colab** for full cloud reproducibility.  
- Designed a **5-layer CNN** to extract features and classify gestures.  
- Achieved **high accuracy** on validation data within 12 epochs.  
- Integrated **real-time testing** with uploaded images.  
- Demonstrates how deep learning can recognize visual patterns effectively.
